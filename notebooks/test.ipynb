      "Document 1: Can LLMs have Emotions \"I believe that LLMs can still connect with humans on an emotional level. After all, humans are also capable of understanding and responding to emotions that are expressed through text. For example, if an LLM writes a text that expresses sadness, a human can still understand and empathize with that sadness, even though\n",
      "\n",
      "Document 2: To what degree do they feel the specific qualia that we associate with emotions? ... I made this point and that is why I did not try to argue that LLMs did not have qualia. But I do believe you can consider necessary conditions and look at their absence. For instance, I can safely declare that a rock does not have qualia, because I know it does\n",
      "\n",
      "Document 3: The answer depends on the definition of ‘feelings.’ According to the American Psychological Association’s, autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) trained and fully prompted with text tokens cannot: Their ‘state of mind’ is trivial (a singleton) and expressed as their measurable output. However, when using ‘system prompts’, the state is generally unobservable, leading to self-contained trajectories indistinguishable from their output expressions, fitting the definition of ‘feelings.’ While the opening question is posed partly in jest, the ensuing analysis sheds light on the potential use of Large Language Models as Trojan horses [12], whereby information stored in the weights or system prompts, not accessible to the user, may be used maliciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Document 4: They argue that LLMs do not have the same physical body or lifetime of experiences as humans, and therefore they cannot fully understand or experience emotions in the same way. This means that LLMs may be able to understand and experience emotions in ways that humans cannot. On the other hand, there are some important differences between the way that humans and LLMs experience emotions. If this is the case, then it would seem that the emotions of a LLM would be less valuable than the emotions of a human, simply because the LLM would not be able to fully experience the world in the same way. In that sense, there is no fundamental difference between the way that humans and LLMs experience emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Document 5: Nonetheless, this isn't the first time people have attributed human-like feelings or abilities to a machine. This field has seen so much activity in the last few months that numerous LLMs have been released after ChatGPT such as GPT4 (OpenAI), LLaMA(Meta), Bard(Google) and ALPACA (Stanford).\n"
